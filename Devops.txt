We keep saying that DevOps is a culture. But what does that mean?

DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development and information-technology operations which aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.

Here’s How you can do it:

Since DevOps is more of a cross-functional mode of working, people working under this culture prefer using a DevOps toolset as a toolchain that performs the following functions:

Coding – code development and review, source code management tools, code merging
Building – continuous integration tools, build status
Testing – continuous testing tools that provide quick and timely feedback on business risks
Packaging – artifact repository, application pre-deployment staging
Releasing – change management, release approvals, release automation
Configuring – infrastructure configuration and management, infrastructure as code tools
Monitoring – applications performance monitoring.

DevOps is a set of practices, tools, and a cultural philosophy that emphasizes collaboration, communication, and automation between software development (Dev) and information technology operations (Ops) teams. Its aim is to shorten the system development lifecycle and deliver high-quality software faster and more reliably.
